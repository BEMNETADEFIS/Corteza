## Why
Corteza enables us to explore the human brain, experiencing its reactions based on the perception and behaviour of a subject. It gives us a glance at the beauty and complexity of the human brain and shows how it can be stimulated and altered through diverse parameters.

## How
A customized brain computer interface (BCI) and improved measurement devices are used to collect data from specific regions of the head and generate accurate signals that communicate directly with a real-time graphic engine morphing them through sound and images into a digital landscape. The audience can observe the interaction between the subject and the system and how the subjects' brain reacts to the external stimulation it receives, translating it into control signals that change the whole environment.
